# NumeriX
Numerical Analysis Toolkit

## Acknowledgments

This project was developed with insights gained from various textbooks and academic resources on numerical analysis. Key references that informed the principles and methods applied in this project include:

- SÃ¼li, E., & Mayers, D. F. (2003). An Introduction to Numerical Analysis. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.
- Another APA citation here once I find one

These resources provided a solid foundation in numerical methods, which was instrumental in the development of NumeriX and its corresponding high-performance numerical analysis library, NumeriXCore.
