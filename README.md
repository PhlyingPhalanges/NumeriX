# NumeriX: Numerical Analysis Toolkit

## Acknowledgments

This project was developed using insights from two key resources, one on numerical analysis and the other on C++ programming:

- SÃ¼li, E., & Mayers, D. F. (2003). An Introduction to Numerical Analysis. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.
- Stroustrup, B. (2013). The C++ programming language (4th ed.). Addison-Wesley.

These resources provided a solid foundation in numerical methods and C++, which was instrumental in the development of NumeriX and its corresponding high-performance numerical analysis library, NumeriXCore.
